/*:
 ## Can you count to four? You can play the drums!!ðŸ˜Ž
 
 - The first thing to learn is to count in the correct tempo.
 
 Once you hit the **Run my code** button, you will hear a tic sound to represent the tempo.
 \
 This indicates how fast you are going to count to 4.
 \
 After a while, a couple of blue notes will fall from the sky on each tic sound.
 \
 Try to hit the blue section whenever the note reaches the blue instrument.
