 ## Time for the real challenge!!
 
 Play the **bass drum (green section)** in the middle at counts **1** and **3** along with the **hit hat**.
 \
 All together with what you learned in the previous exercises.
 
 - Important:
 Putting all the instruments together may be tough, so you can slow the tempo if you need.
