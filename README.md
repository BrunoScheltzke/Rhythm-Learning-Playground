# The app👨‍💻
If you ever struggled when learning a new musical instrument, then maybe rhythm is one of your problems. That's the main porpouse of my app: Help people to learn rhythm. In the app there is a basic drum beat, used in tons of famous songs, that I broke down into 4 simple lessons. At the end of the book you are able to play the whole beat along with a custom song I created for the app using Garage Band.

### How I came up with the idea💡
I really love music. I can play many different musical instruments. But I am not so good at teaching. Once I tried to teach my cousin guitar, and we failed as he was not so good with rhythm plus my lack of teaching skills💩.

### Resources
Using [Garage Band](https://www.apple.com/ca/mac/garageband/) I was able to create the notes for each drum instrument and also the song played in the last lesson. I used [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) to create the art of the project.

## Can I play? 🥁
The app is called DuBeat and it is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/br/app/dubeat/id1386900067?l=en...)

## Instruments 🎹
8-Bit Music Maker supports 3 different "wave forms", or "instruments", as I like to refer to them. While these are not the only wave forms supported in 8-bit architectures, they were certainly the most popular in 80's video games.

To record, hit the record button and make sure you press play on the sequencer:

## I really struggle with rhythm! What can I do?😭
You can change the tempo (how fast you are supposed to play) with the following:
* `metronome.setTempo funcion` -> Playground Book
* `Tempo on lesson menu` -> App

## Up next 👊
* **Create more lessons** so you can be the best😎!
* **Upload more songs to the app** so you can have more fun with your new skills
