/*:
 ## Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ve done until now:
 
 - You learned a part of a beat of tons of famous songs like **Highway to Hell - AC/DC, Billie Jean - Michael Jackson**
 - You learned that the [hit-hat](glossary://hit-hat) is following the tempo at beats 1, 2, 3 and 4. And then it is repeated.
 
 # Up Next:
 
 Time to add [snare](glossary://snare) notes to the [hit-hat](glossary://hit-hat) notes we just played.
 \
 The [snare](glossary://snare) is represented by the **yellow section** in the very left.
 \
 So, along with the [hit-hat](glossary://hit-hat), play the yellow section at count 2 and count 4.
 
 - Important:
 It really helps if you count from 1 to 4 out loud along with the click sound.
