/*:
 ## Time for the real challenge!!
 
 Play the [bass](glossary://bass) (green section in the middle) at beats **1** and **3** along with the [hit-hat](glossary://hit-hat).
 \
 All together with what you learned in the previous exercises.
 
 - Important:
 Putting all the instruments together may be tough, so you can slow the [tempo](glossary://tempo) in the function [metronome](glossary://metronome).setTempo() if you need.
